Mentor — perfect. Here’s a crisp, analysis‑only summary of your **full run‑through** (with `CLEAR` at the top). I’ve mapped **every command from your HELP** to what happened: OK / Partial / Error / Not Tested. No fixes proposed—just facts.

# Run context

* Build: `dottalk++ alpha‑v3.1 (Aug 19 2025 10:57:19)`
* Tables present: `students.dbf` (+ others), temp table `tmpmini.dbf`.
* Note: `CLEAR` at start was necessary to avoid nuking printed output.

# Command coverage & observed behavior

| Command          | Result / Notes                                                                                  |

| `VERSION`        | **OK** — prints alpha‑v3.1 and build timestamp.                                                 |
| `HELP`           | **OK** — shows full verb list.                                                                  |
| `DIR`            | **OK** — lists DBFs/EXE/LIB; also shows `*.pack_tmp` artifacts.                                 |
| `USE`            | **OK** — opens; counts update (204→206 after appends).                                          |
| `STATUS`         | **Partial** — basic info; shows `[DELETED]` on current; lacks tag/order/last‑error.             |
| `STRUCT`         | **OK** — six fields, types/lengths correct.                                                     |
| `FIELDS`         | **OK** — mirrors STRUCT output.                                                                 |

| `SETINDEX`       | **Partial** — accepted; “Order set to TAG L (stub)”.                                            |
| `ASCEND`         | **OK** — “Order: ASCENDING.”                                                                    |

| `TOP`            | **Partial** — prints only `Recno: N` (no rows).                                                 |
| `BOTTOM`         | **Partial** — prints only `Recno: N`.                                                           |
| `RECNO`          | **OK** — prints `1` after `GOTO 1`.                                                             |
| `GOTO`           | **OK** — `GOTO 1` positions; prints `Recno: 1`.                                                 |
| `SEEK`           | **Stub** — `SEEK "MILLER"` → “Not found. (stub)”.                                               |
| `FIND`           | **Usage Error** — requires `FIND <field> <needle>`; given `FIND "MI"`.                          |
| `LIST`           | **OK** — prints 10 aligned rows; footer “10 record(s)…”.                                        |
| `DISPLAY`        | **OK** — vertical display of current record.                                                    |
| `DUMP`           | **OK** — `DUMP TOP 2` prints two vertical records.                                              |
| `COUNT`          | **OK** — returns visible count (e.g., 203).                                                     |
| `APPEND BLANK`   | **Partial** — `APPEND BLANK 2` appended **1** (message shows 1).                                |
| `APPEND`         | **OK** — appended 1 blank record.                                                               |
| `EDIT`           | **OK** — `EDIT LAST_NAME WITH "TMPEDIT"` worked (alias of REPLACE).                             |
| `REPLACE`        | **Mixed** — worked on character/num; `REPLACE ACTIVE WITH .F.` rejected literal `.F.` (type L). |
| `DELETE`         | **OK** — “1 deleted”.                                                                           |

| `RECALL`         | **Partial** — after `UNDELETE`, `RECALL` said “0 record(s)” (context‑sensitive).                |
| `PACK`           | **Error** — failed to replace original; left `*.pack_tmp` (Windows file lock issue).            |
| `EXPORT`         | **OK** — `students_out.csv` and `tmpmini.csv` created.                                          |
| `IMPORT`         | **OK** — appends rows; `tmpmini` count doubled (expected append behavior).                      |
| `COPY`           | **Usage** — required `COPY <DBFNAME>` or `COPY TO <DBFNAME>`; none executed.                    |
| `CREATE`         | **OK** — `tmpmini` created/opened with 3 fields.                                                |
| `SELECT`         | **OK** — `SELECT 1/2` switches areas.                                                           |
| `AREA`           | **OK** — reports active area and file/rec counts.                                               |
| `REFRESH`        | **Not Tested** — not invoked in this run.                                                       |
| `COLOR`          | **Not Tested** — not invoked in this run.                                                       |
| `CLEAR`          | **OK** — worked; needed at top to preserve output.                                              |
| `CLS`            | **Not Tested** — not invoked in this run.                                                       |
| `BOTTOM` / `TOP` | (See above) Both **Partial** (position only).                                                   |

# Key observations (analysis only)

* **SET‑family gaps:** `SET INDEX TO` / `SET INDEX` are unrecognized; `SETINDEX` exists but admits “stub”.
* **Navigation output:** `TOP`/`BOTTOM` change position but do not render rows; only `Recno` is printed.
* **SEEK** is **stubbed**; no exact‑match behavior yet.
* **PACK** consistently fails to replace original; leaves `*.pack_tmp` (both `students` and `tmpmini`).
* **Booleans in REPLACE:** `.T./.F.` literal rejected for `L` field (parser/type coercion mismatch).
* **APPEND BLANK n:** numeric argument ignored → always appends 1.
* **FIND** requires explicit field; usage messaging is correct.
* **STATUS** lacks index/order/last‑error lines (but does show `[DELETED]` on current when applicable).
* **Multi‑area works:** `SELECT`/`AREA` show expected state; `USE students` reopens in area 2 with `Recno: 1`.

# Data/state deltas from run

* `students.dbf`: grew from 204 → 206 (appends); `PACK` failed; temp `students.dbf.pack_tmp` present.
* `tmpmini.dbf`: created; grew to 4; `PACK` failed; `tmpmini.dbf.pack_tmp` present; export/import exercised.

# Not executed this pass (for completeness in analysis set)

* `REFRESH`, `COLOR`, `CLS` (you did use `CLEAR`).

If you want, I can turn this into a **one‑page checklist** (no fixes) you can staple to the alpha‑v3.1 run book: each command with a checkbox and your observed line(s).
